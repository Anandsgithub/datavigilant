# ETL
| Project Topic | Project Description | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Combining Data from Multiple Provider Sources into EPDSV2 | This project involved integrating data from various provider sources into a single repository called EPDSV2. Providers are stored in Oracle, sourced from Mainframe DB2. The provider records are then sent to downstream systems for further processing or changes. This comprehensive ETL process ensures data accuracy and consistency across multiple platforms. | Informatica, Oracle, Mainframe DB2| 
| Migrating Data from New Business into EPDSV2 | This project involves migrating data from various new business sources into a single repository called EPDSV2. The data from providers is stored in Teradata, sourced from Mainframe DB2, IMS DB, SQL, Snowflake, and Oracle. The provider records are then processed in UNIX and Shell environments for further downstream processing or changes. This comprehensive ETL process ensures data accuracy and consistency across multiple platforms. | Informatica, Teradata, Mainframe DB2, IMS DB, SQL, Snowflake, Oracle, UNIX, Shell, Power BI |  
| Automating Data Extraction and Transformation | This project focuses on automating the entire ETL process, eliminating the need for human intervention. Data extraction and transformation are performed seamlessly across multiple sources, and an email notification is triggered upon process completion. The aim is to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness in data processing. | Python, UNIX, Shell, Automated Email Notifications, Power BI |
